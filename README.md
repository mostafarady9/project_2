Customer Billing System Project is a simple console application designed to demonstrate the
practical use of C programming language and its features as well as to generate an application
that can be used in any departmental store, shop, caf√©, etc. for billing to the customer.
You can use this application to keep the records such as name, address, mobile number, paid
amount, due amount, payment date, etc. of your regular customer. Moreover, if you have a
new customer, you can add and edit the account at any time
